# Moose

Moose is a distributed dataflow framework for encrypted machine learning and data processing. It is written primarily in Rust and includes a compiler, runtime, and Python eDSL and bindings.

Computations are expressed using either the Python eDSL or by programming against the Rust API. These _logical computations_ are compiled to _physical computations_ that in turn can be executed using the runtime. Each operation in the dataflow graphs are pinned to a _placement_ which represent either a physical host or one of several kinds of virtual execution units, including some backed by secure multi-party computation (MPC) protocols.

Moose includes an API, a compiler, and a runtime. Itâ€™s designed to be secure, fast, scalable, and extensible. Moose is production ready and secure by default.

- The `Moose eDSL` is an easy-to-use language for expressing programs of algebraic operations on `n`-dimensional arrays, which may contain inputs from one or more parties. Moose programs can be written in Python ([PyMoose](/pymoose)) or directly in Rust ([examples](/moose/examples)).
- The `Moose Compiler` builds, type checks, and optimizes the operations into a distributed data flow graph. We call this encrypted data flow.
- The `Moose Runtime` securely and efficiently executes the graph across a network of (potentially untrusted) compute clusters while protecting the secrecy of the inputs.

Moose contains the mathematical primitives to compose machine learning and deep learning models.

Moose is designed to support many different secure multi-party computation protocols. Initially, replicated secret sharing is supported. Contributions of additional protocols are welcome.


The implementation is documented on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/moose/) and the cryptographic protocols are documented in our [whitepaper](https://github.com/tf-encrypted/moose-whitepaper).

Moose is a community driven, open source project. Moose was created at Cape.

## Installation

In many cases you will want to install only the Python bindings on eg your laptop, and only the Moose tools on the servers making up the distributed cluster.

Install the Python bindings using:

```sh
pip install moose-python
```

and install the Moose tools using:

```sh
cargo install moose
```

You will need to have OpenBLAS installed for both:

- Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install libopenblas-dev`

- macOS: `homebrew install openblas`

You will need to have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) installed for the latter.

Please see [DEVELOP.md](./DEVELOP.md) for further instructions on how to install and work with the source code.

## Example

The following is a simple encrypted computation using the Python bindings:

```python
import numpy as np
import pymoose as pm

alice = pm.host_placement("alice")
bob = pm.host_placement("bob")
carole = pm.host_placement("carole")
rep = pm.replicated_placement("rep", players=[alice, bob, carole])

runtime = pm.GrpcMooseRuntime({
    alice: "localhost:50000",
    bob: "localhost:50001",
    carole: "localhost:50002",
})
runtime.set_default()

@pm.computation
def simple_computation(
    x: pm.Argument(placement=alice, vtype=pm.TensorType(pm.float64)),
    y: pm.Argument(placement=bob, vtype=pm.TensorType(pm.float64)),
):
    with alice:
        x = pm.cast(x, dtype=pm.fixed(14, 23))

    with bob:
        y = pm.cast(y, dtype=pm.fixed(14, 23))

    with rep:
        z = pm.add(x, y)

    with carole:
        v = pm.cast(z, dtype=pm.float64)

    return v

result = my_computation(
    x=np.array([1.0, 2.0], dtype=np.float64),
    y=np.array([3.0, 4.0], dtype=np.float64),
)
print(result)
```

Make sure to have three instances of Comet running before running the Python code:

```sh
comet --identity localhost:50000 --port 50000
comet --identity localhost:50001 --port 50001
comet --identity localhost:50002 --port 50002
```

In this example the inputs are provided by the Python script but Moose also supports loading data locally from e.g. NumPy files.
