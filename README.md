# Moose

Moose is a framework for secure multi-party computation, written in Rust.

Moose includes an API, a compiler, and a runtime. Itâ€™s designed to be secure, fast, scalable, and extensible. Moose is production ready and secure by default.

### Components
- `The Moose API` is an easy to use method of expressing a program of mathematical operations (addition, matrix multiplication, comparison, etc) which may contain inputs from one or more parties. Moose programs can be written in Python ([PyMoose](/pymoose)) or directly in Rust ([examples](/moose/examples)).
- `The Moose Compiler` builds, type checks, and optimizes the operations into a distributed data flow graph (we call this encrypted data flow).
- `The Moose Runtime` securely and efficiently executes the graph across a network of (potentially untrusted) compute clusters while protecting the secrecy of the inputs.

Moose contains the mathematical primitives to compose machine learning and deep learning models (see [PyCape](https://github.com/capeprivacy/pycape)).

Moose is designed to support many different secure multi-party computation protocols. Initially, replicated secret sharing is supported. Contributions of additional protocols are welcome.

### Community
Moose is a community driven, open source project. Moose was created at Cape, where it continues to be actively developed.

## Installation

### Bootstrapping

**NOTE**: We are using [rust stable](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/concepts/channels.html) for the runtime.

Install python development headers for your OS. (eg - `python3-dev` for Ubuntu, or `python38-devel` for OpenSUSE).

Install OpenBLAS development headers via `libopenblas-dev` for Ubuntu.

To install the library and all of its dependencies, run:
```
make install
```

This unwraps into two other targets, which are kept separate for purposes of caching in CI:

```
make pydep  # install dependencies
make pylib  # install runtime Python library
```

You will also need to compile protobuf files before running any examples that use gRPC, which you can do via:

```
make build
```

### Running locally for testing

```
python main.py --runtime test
```

### Running with remote cluster

You can start a cluster locally using the following:

```
cd docker/dev
docker-compose up
```

Once done you can run the following to evaluate a computation on it:

```
python main.py --runtime remote
```

### Developing

To ensure your changes will pass our CI, it's wise to run the following commands before committing:

```
make ci-ready

# or, more verbosely:

make fmt
make lint
make test-ci
```

### Testing

There are three types of testing regimes which can be found in the Makefile:

```
make test
make test-ci
make test-long
```

When doing local development we suggest using `make test` command. The
`make-ci` command is used mostly for ci purposes and runs a smaller range of test cases. For
a more extensive test suite we recommend using `make test-long` command.


### Releasing

Follow these steps to release a new version:

1. create a new branch from `main`, eg `git checkout -b new-release`

2. run `make release`

3. if successful then `git push` to create a new PR

Once your PR has been merged to `main`:

1. checkout main branch: `git checkout main`

2. create a new tag *matching the version* of `python-bindings`: eg `git tag v{x.y.z}`

3. push tag: `git push origin v{x.y.z}`

4. create a release on GitHub based on your [tag](https://github.com/tf-encrypted/runtime/tags)

If needed then tags on GitHub can be deleted using `git push --delete origin {tag-name}`

### Rust Development
You will need a working [installation of Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) to compile and test this project.

We compile and test against the stable toolchain so make sure to either set the stable toolchain as the default using `rustup default stable`.

We require code to be formatted according to `cargo fmt` so make sure to run this command before submitted your work. You should also run `cargo clippy` to lint your code.

To ease your development we encourage you to install the following extra cargo commands:

- [`cargo watch`](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-watchcargo-watch) will type check your code on every save;  `cargo watch --exec test` will run all tests on every save.

- [`cargo outdated`](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-outdated) checks if your dependencies are up to date.

- [`cargo audit`](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-audit) checks if any vulnerabilities have been detected for your current dependencies.

- [`cargo deny`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny) checks security advisories and licence conflicts.

- [`cargo release`](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-release) automates the release cycle, including bumping versions.

- [`cargo udeps`](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-udeps) to list unused dependencies.

- [`cargo expand`](https://github.com/dtolnay/cargo-expand) to dump what macros expand into.
