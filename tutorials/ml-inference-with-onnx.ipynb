    "You are a healthcare AI startup who has trained a model to diagnose heart disease. You would like to serve this model to a hospital to help doctors diagnose potential heart disease for their patients. However, the patients' data is too sensitive to be shared with the AI startup. For this reason, you would like to encrypt the patient's data and run the model on it.\n",

    "- Train a model with [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)\n",

    "- Convert the model from ONNX to a Moose computation.\n",
    "- Run encrypted inference by evaluating the Moose computation.\n",

    "### Training\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we use a synthetic dataset. The dataset contains 10 features (`X`). Each record is labeled (`y`) by 0 or 1 (heart disease or not). For the model, we train a logistic regression with [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/). But you could experiment with other models such as `XGBClassifier` from [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html#) or even [Multi-layer Perceptron](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neural_networks_supervised.html#multi-layer-perceptron).\n",
