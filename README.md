# Moose

Moose is a distributed dataflow framework for encrypted machine learning and data processing. It is written primarily in Rust and includes a compiler, runtime, and Python eDSL and bindings.

Computations are expressed using either the Python eDSL or by programming against the Rust API. These _logical computations_ are compiled to _physical computations_ that in turn can be executed using the runtime. Each operation in the dataflow graphs are pinned to a _placement_ which represent either a physical host or one of several kinds of virtual execution units, including some backed by secure multi-party computation (MPC) protocols.

Moose includes an API, a compiler, and a runtime. Itâ€™s designed to be secure, fast, scalable, and extensible. Moose is production ready and secure by default.

- The `Moose eDSL` is an easy-to-use language for expressing programs of algebraic operations on `n`-dimensional arrays, which may contain inputs from one or more parties. Moose programs can be written in Python ([PyMoose](/pymoose)) or directly in Rust ([examples](/moose/examples)).
- The `Moose Compiler` builds, type checks, and optimizes the operations into a distributed data flow graph. We call this encrypted data flow.
- The `Moose Runtime` securely and efficiently executes the graph across a network of (potentially untrusted) compute clusters while protecting the secrecy of the inputs.

Moose contains the mathematical primitives to compose machine learning and deep learning models.

Moose is designed to support many different secure multi-party computation protocols. Initially, replicated secret sharing is supported. Contributions of additional protocols are welcome.


The implementation is documented on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/moose/) and the cryptographic protocols are documented in our [whitepaper](https://github.com/tf-encrypted/moose-whitepaper).

Moose is a community driven, open source project. Moose was created at Cape.

## Installation

You will need to have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) and OpenBLAS installed. Once you have these you can install Moose using:

```sh
cargo install moose
```

If you plan to use the Python bindings you can install these using:

```sh
pip install moose-python
```

OpenBLAS may be installed using:

- Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install libopenblas-dev`

- macOS: `homebrew install openblas`

Please see [DEVELOP.md](./DEVELOP.md) for further instructions on how to install and work with the Moose source code.

## Example

```python
TODO: simple local example using PyMoose
```

Please see the [examples](./examples/) directory for more ways to use Moose, including running in an actual distributed setting.
